          First task! We want you to make a slider. It should look
          (more or less) like on the gif.

          You will find all necessary assets in the <span>assets</span> folder in
          the root of the project.
          <br />
          And remember - <span>do not use</span> any external library for
          this task.

          It doesn't have to be identical - but do your best to make it look
          good!

          Place your slider below this paragraph.
